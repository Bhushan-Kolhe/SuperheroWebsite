  <h1>Wonder woman's Powers</h1>
  <h2>Superhuman Strength</h2>
  <p>Granted by Demeter (Goddess of the Earth). Diana is literally as strong as the Earth because of her link to the planet granted to her by Demeter. She is said to be "stronger than Hercules". Wonder Woman is as strong as Superman himself and able to physically outmatch other beings such as Supergirl.</p>
  <h2>Superhuman Durability</h2>
  <p>Granted by Demeter (Goddess of the Earth). Diana possesses a high resistance to damage and magical attacks. Her resistance to injury is not quite as great as any of the above mentioned metahumans. However, due to her vast threshold for pain and her amazon ability to heal at a superhuman rate, this easily makes up for the difference. She has withstood considerable bludgeoning damage in the form of hand to hand combat with metahuman opponents such as Superman and Captain Marvel. She has considerable resistance to human weaponries, though this is not absolute; Bullets can cause minor to moderate injury, but never life threatening.</p>
  <h2>Flight</h2>
  <p>Granted by Hermes (the Messenger God). Wonder Woman is capable of unassisted flight by gliding on air currents.</p>
  <h2>Superhuman Speed</h2>
  <p>Granted by Hermes (the Messenger God). She is able to think, react and move at superhuman speeds. According to Flash, she can easily keep up with him if he is at regular cruising speed (but not at top speed).</p>
  <h2>Superhuman Reflexes</h2>
  <p>Granted by Hermes (the Messenger God). Wonder Woman's reflexes are far beyond the limitations of the finest human athletes. She has been able to react to a barrage of gunfire from multiple opponents at once unharmed. Batman noted that her reflexes are superior to that of Superman.</p>
  <h2>Superhuman Stamina</h2>
  <p>Wonder Woman can last a great deal of time in any fight and with virtually anyone. She has held her own in combat with foes as powerful as a Doomsday clone. She doesn't tire out, as her body produces no lactic acids in her muscles.</p>
  <h2>Enhanced Healing Factor</h2>
  <p>Granted by Demeter (Goddess of Earth). Like the Earth, Diana is constantly renewing herself, allowing her to quickly heal mild to moderate injuries at an amazing rate. Her normal regenerative abilities allow her to recover from injury within seconds to minutes. She possesses an incredible immunity from poisons, toxins, as well as disease.</p>
  <h2>Oneness With Fire</h2>
  <p>Granted by Hestia (Goddess of the Hearth). Apparently making her a focus of truth.</p>
  <h2>Dimensional Teleportation</h2>
  <p>On occasion, Wonder Woman can literally leave the planet through meditation. She did this to rescue Artemis when she was in hell, and has even conversed with the Greek Gods on occasion.</p>
